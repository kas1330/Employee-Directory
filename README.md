Then use npm start to launch the app. The application should now launch to localhost:3000. Change the "homepage": in your package.json to your own github and repo names. You can then use 'gh-pages -d build' to launch the deployed page or you can use the link to the deployed app.

## Testing

The easiest way to test the function of the application would be to click on the link to the deployed app on GitHub pages. You should see a list of 10 employees and a search bar. When you type letters into the search bar the the list of employees should filter down to the ones who contain those letters. The more difficult way to test would be to git clone the repository and npm install all packages. Then go to the terminal and type npm start. This will launch the app on loacalhost:3000 and you should be able to follow the same steps as the deployed version to test the app. If you want to deploy it from your own github pages, use 'gh-pages -d build' to launch it.
